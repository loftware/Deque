# Loft_Deque

A random-access, mutable collection with O(1) size-changing operations at both
ends.

## Motivation

Say you have a growing number of items to process, and you'd like to process them in order. A queue
is an efficient data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a First-In-First-Out
(FIFO) order. A deque is an extension to the queue data structure that enables elements to be added
or removed at both ends efficiently, and efficient access to all elements within the data structure.
